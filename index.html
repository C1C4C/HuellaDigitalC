    <p>A digital footprint is data that is left behind when users have been online. There are two types of digital footprints: passive and active. Passive digital footprints are data collected automatically without the user's knowledge or consent. Active digital footprints are data collected manually by the user, often with the explicit consent of the user, and often include data such as websites and apps that the user visits, emails and messages, and other online activities.</p>
